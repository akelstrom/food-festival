# Food Festival

## Description

This is an app called Food Festival, it was an exsisting appication, and the client was looking for help with two main blockers. The client needed a fast and performant application, especially on mobile, because the app is designed for event attendees who will be using it on their phones.

I used Google's Lighthouse web auditing tool to investigate metrics and performance issues with the app, and implemented a few strategies to make improvements. For example, I used Webpack to make the production code more efficient, and also used it to automatically minify the JavaScript files and images.

The client also want to turn the app into a PWA, or Progressive Web Application. For the Food Festival app, this means that event attendees would be able to access data such as schedules and vendor locations without worrying about having a cell signal or WiFi.
